This project was undertaken as a part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.
The object of the project was to make a number of optimizations to a pre-supplied web app to achieve a page speed of 60 frames per second.

During the course of this project I did the following:

• Learned about how the browser retrieves HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, & then processes them into rendered pixels by means of the Critical Rendering Path (CRP).

• Explored the importance of maintaining a page speed of at least 60 frames per second on all moving page elements and successfully utilized various methods to achieve this goal.

• Used my knowledge of the critical rendering path in order to manipulate segments of code to ensure that the browser was making as few requests for materials as possible & that it was not repeating tasks unnecessarily.

• Implemented such measures as compressing & minifying code, in-lining essential CSS & JavaScript directly into the HTML, async-ing non-essential JavaScript files & using media queries on non-essential segments of CSS to ensure that they would not block rendering.
